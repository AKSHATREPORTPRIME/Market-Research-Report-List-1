<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Cable Coating Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>IntumescentCableCoatings</li><li>Non-IntumescentCableCoatings</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Cable coatings are used to protect cables from fire hazards. Intumescent cable coatings are designed to expand when exposed to heat, forming a protective barrier that insulates the cable and prevents the spread of fire. These coatings are effective in maintaining the integrity and functionality of cables during a fire incident. On the other hand, non-intumescent cable coatings do not expand when exposed to heat, but they still provide a protective layer that delays the spread of fire. Both types of cable coatings play a crucial role in fire safety measures for various applications.</p></p>
