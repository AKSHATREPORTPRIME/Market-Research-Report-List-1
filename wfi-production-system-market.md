<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The WFI Production System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Vapor Compression Distillation</li><li>Reverse Osmosis + Ultrafiltration (UF)</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The WFI Production System Market includes two main types - Vapor Compression Distillation and Reverse Osmosis + Ultrafiltration (UF). Vapor Compression Distillation method involves using heat energy to vaporize impure water and then condense the vapor to obtain high-purity water. On the other hand, Reverse Osmosis + Ultrafiltration (UF) utilizes pressure to force water through a semi-permeable membrane, allowing water molecules to pass while blocking impurities. Both techniques are widely used in industries that require high-quality water for various applications, such as pharmaceuticals and electronics manufacturing.</p></p>
