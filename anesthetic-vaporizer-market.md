<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Anesthetic Vaporizer Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Plenum Vaporizers</li><li>Drawover Vaporizers</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Anesthetic vaporizers are devices used in hospitals and clinics to administer anesthesia to patients during surgeries or medical procedures. There are two types of anesthetic vaporizers: plenum vaporizers and drawover vaporizers. Plenum vaporizers are directly connected to anesthetic machines and are commonly used in modern hospitals. They have a large internal space where the anesthetic liquid is vaporized and mixed with a carrier gas before being delivered to the patient. On the other hand, drawover vaporizers are portable and do not require an anesthetic machine. They work by drawing ambient air over the liquid anesthetic and delivering the vapor to the patient.</p></p>
