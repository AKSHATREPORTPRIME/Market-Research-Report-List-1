<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stationary Grain Dryers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Dryer</li><li>Vertical Dryer</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Stationary grain dryers are commonly used in agricultural industries to remove moisture content from harvested grains. There are two types of stationary grain dryers: horizontal dryers and vertical dryers. Horizontal dryers have a horizontal drying column where grain is continuously pushed through by augers or conveyors, allowing for a uniform and efficient drying process. Vertical dryers, on the other hand, have a vertical drying column that uses gravity to move the grain downward, resulting in a slower drying process but with less damage to the grain. Both types of dryers serve the purpose of reducing moisture levels to prolong grain storage.</p></p>
