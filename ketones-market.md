<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ketones Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Saturated Ketone</li><li>Unsaturated Ketone</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Ketones are organic compounds that possess a carbonyl group (C=O) bonded to two carbon atoms. Saturated ketones are the ones where the carbon atoms connected to the carbonyl group are both surrounded by single bonds to other atoms. They have a stable structure and are commonly used as solvents, pharmaceutical intermediates, and flavoring agents. On the other hand, unsaturated ketones contain a double bond between one of the carbon atoms connected to the carbonyl group and another carbon atom. They have more reactivity and are primarily utilized as raw materials for the synthesis of pharmaceuticals, polymers, and fragrances.</p></p>
