<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Underwater Research Side Scan Sonar Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-beam</li><li>Multi-beam</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Underwater Research Side Scan Sonar Market includes two types: Single-beam and Multi-beam. Single-beam sonar uses a single sound beam emitted directly down into the water, providing a narrow field of view but greater depth penetration. It is suitable for mapping large areas and locating underwater objects. On the other hand, Multi-beam sonar emits multiple beams simultaneously, offering a wider coverage area with a lower depth penetration. It is ideal for detailed mapping of the seafloor, capturing higher resolution images, and accurately measuring underwater features.</p></p>
