<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transportation Composites and Plastics Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermoplastic</li><li>Thermoset</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Transportation composites and plastics market can be divided into two main types: thermoplastics and thermosets. Thermoplastics are polymers that can be melted and re-molded multiple times without experiencing any significant degradation in their physical properties. They offer advantages such as high strength, durability, and cost-effectiveness. On the other hand, thermosets are materials that undergo a chemical process called cross-linking during polymerization, resulting in irreversible changes in their structure. They exhibit superior thermal stability, mechanical strength, and resistance to chemicals, making them suitable for various transportation applications.</p></p>
