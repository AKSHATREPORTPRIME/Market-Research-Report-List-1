<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Extended Reality Display Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD)</li><li>Organic Light-Emitting Diode (OLED)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Extended Reality (XR) Display market comprises two major types: Liquid Crystal Displays (LCD) and Organic Light-Emitting Diodes (OLED). LCD technology uses liquid crystals to manipulate light and create images. It offers good color reproduction and sharpness but has limited contrast ratios. On the other hand, OLED technology uses organic compounds that emit light when an electric current is applied. It provides high contrast ratios, vibrant colors, and faster response times but can be prone to burn-in issues. Both technologies play a significant role in providing immersive visual experiences in XR applications.</p></p>
