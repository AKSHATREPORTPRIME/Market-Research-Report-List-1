<p><h1>Global Solid Carbon Dioxide Market by Types, Applications, and Major Players, with Regional Growth Rate Analysis and Development Situation, from 2023 to 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Solid carbon dioxide, also known as dry ice, is a solid form of carbon dioxide gas. It is formed when carbon dioxide gas is rapidly compressed and cooled to extremely low temperatures. Solid carbon dioxide does not melt into a liquid but sublimates directly from a solid to a gas at -78.5 degrees Celsius (-109.3 degrees Fahrenheit).</p><p>The solid carbon dioxide market is projected to witness significant growth in the coming years. One of the key drivers for this growth is the increasing demand from the food and beverage industry. Solid carbon dioxide is widely used in food preservation and transportation due to its ability to maintain low temperatures. It is also used as a coolant in the medical industry for transporting and storing organs, tissues, and certain medications.</p><p>Additionally, the rising demand for solid carbon dioxide in the cleaning and maintenance industry is expected to fuel market growth. Solid carbon dioxide is utilized in dry ice blasting, which is an environmentally friendly and efficient cleaning method that uses compressed air to propel dry ice pellets. This method is gaining popularity as it does not produce any secondary waste and is non-toxic.</p><p>Furthermore, the healthcare sector is anticipated to contribute to the growth of the solid carbon dioxide market. Solid carbon dioxide finds applications in cryotherapy, where it is used to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue growths such as warts and certain skin lesions.</p><p>The market is expected to witness a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.2% during the forecasted period. Factors such as technological advancements, increasing consumer awareness, and the growing need for eco-friendly cleaning solutions are likely to drive the demand for solid carbon dioxide. However, the market may face challenges related to transportation and storage, as solid carbon dioxide requires specialized handling due to its extreme cold temperatures.</p></p>
