<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Stainless Pipe Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Welded</li><li>Seamless</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The stainless pipe market can be categorized into two types: welded and seamless. Welded pipes are manufactured by joining two or more pieces of steel together, resulting in a continuous longitudinal weld. These pipes are commonly used in industries where strength and durability are crucial. On the other hand, seamless pipes are manufactured without any welding or joints and are produced from a solid cylindrical piece of steel. Seamless pipes are preferred in industries requiring a high level of pressure and corrosion resistance due to their uniformity and the absence of weak points.</p></p>
