<p><h1>Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) Market Growth, Market Trends, COVID-19 Impact, and Forecasts for period from 2023 - 2030</h1></p><p><strong>Market Overview and Report Coverage</strong></p>
<p><p>Blind Spot Monitor (BSM) is a vehicle safety feature that helps drivers detect other vehicles in their blind spots. It uses sensors and cameras to monitor the areas adjacent to the vehicle that are not visible in the side and rearview mirrors. When another vehicle enters the blind spot, the BSM system alerts the driver through visual or audible warnings, reducing the risk of accidents caused by improper lane changes.</p><p>The current outlook of the BSM market is optimistic. With increasing concerns about road safety and rising demand for advanced driver assistance systems, the adoption of BSM is expected to grow significantly. The technology has already gained popularity in high-end and luxury vehicles, and now it is gradually being incorporated into mid-range and entry-level vehicles. Moreover, the regulatory bodies in many countries are mandating the inclusion of BSM in new vehicles, further boosting its market growth.</p><p>Looking into the future, the BSM market is poised for continued expansion. Factors such as the increasing number of vehicles on the road, the rising number of accidents caused by blind spots, and the growing awareness about vehicle safety are expected to drive the market growth. Additionally, advancements in sensor technologies and the integration of BSM with other driver assistance systems, such as lane departure warning and adaptive cruise control, will further enhance the functionality and effectiveness of BSM systems.</p><p>According to the provided information, the BSM market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.4% during the forecasted period. This growth rate indicates a robust market demand and ample opportunities for manufacturers and suppliers in the BSM industry. As more vehicles incorporate this safety feature, the BSM market is expected to witness substantial growth and become an integral part of standard vehicle safety systems.</p></p>
