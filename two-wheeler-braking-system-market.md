<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Two-wheeler Braking System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>ABS Braking System</li><li>CBS Braking System</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The two-wheeler braking system market consists of two main types: ABS (Anti-lock Braking System) and CBS (Combi Brake System). ABS utilizes sensors to detect wheel lock-up during braking, optimizing it by preventing skidding. It is commonly found in higher-end motorcycles and provides enhanced safety. CBS, on the other hand, distributes braking force simultaneously between front and rear wheels when the rear brake is applied, improving stability and reducing stopping distances. CBS is more commonly found in entry-level and mid-range motorcycles, making it a cost-effective option for riders. Both systems contribute to safer two-wheeler riding experiences.</p></p>
