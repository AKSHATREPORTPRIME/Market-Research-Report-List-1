<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dust Control Agents Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Inorganic Salt</li><li>Polymer Emulsion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The dust control agents market can be categorized into two types: inorganic salt and polymer emulsion. Inorganic salt-based dust control agents are derived from salts like magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, or potassium chloride. These agents are effective in reducing dust by absorbing moisture from the air, thereby suppressing dust particles. On the other hand, polymer emulsion-based dust control agents are made by mixing water with polymers. These agents form a cohesive film when applied to surfaces, preventing dust particles from becoming airborne.</p></p>
