<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Air Volume Controllers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Variable Air Volume Controller</li><li>Constant Air Volume Controller</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Air Volume Controllers are devices used in HVAC systems to regulate the airflow and maintain a comfortable indoor environment. The Variable Air Volume (VAV) Controller is designed to adjust the air volume based on varying cooling or heating needs, allowing for energy efficiency and individual temperature control. On the other hand, the Constant Air Volume (CAV) Controller provides a fixed air volume regardless of the thermal load. While VAV Controllers offer flexibility and energy savings, CAV Controllers are suitable for spaces with consistent heating or cooling requirements.</p></p>
