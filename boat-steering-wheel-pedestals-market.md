<p><strong>The Boat Steering Wheel Pedestals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Pinion</li><li>Chain</li><li>Rack-and-pinion</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Boat steering wheel pedestals are available in various types to suit different preferences and boat sizes. Pinion steering system involves a gear mechanism where the steering wheel transmits motion to a pinion gear, which then turns the boat's rudder. Chain steering system functions similarly, with a chain connecting the steering wheel and rudder. Rack-and-pinion steering works by translating the steering wheel's motion into linear movement using a rack and pinion gear combination. Other types may include hydraulic or electric systems, providing alternative means of controlling the boat's steering.</p></p>
