<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Vehicle Clutches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Friction Clutches</li><li>Electromagnetic Clutches</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The Commercial Vehicle Clutches Market mainly consists of two types: Friction Clutches and Electromagnetic Clutches. Friction clutches operate through a surface-to-surface contact mechanism, using friction to transmit power. They are commonly used in manual transmission systems. On the other hand, electromagnetic clutches work by using the magnetic forces generated between a stationary and rotating member to transmit power. These clutches are often found in automatic transmission systems. Both types play a crucial role in commercial vehicles by enabling efficient power transmission and smooth gear shifting.</p></p>
