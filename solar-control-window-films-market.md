<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solar Control Window Films Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Clear (Non-Reflective)</li><li>Dyed (Non-Reflective)</li><li>Vacuum Coated (Reflective)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solar control window films are used to control the amount of heat and light that enters through windows. Clear (non-reflective) films are transparent and primarily aim to reduce heat and prevent fading without altering the appearance of windows. Dyed (non-reflective) films contain a layer of dye that absorbs solar energy, thus reducing glare and heat. Vacuum coated (reflective) films have a reflective metal layer that reflects heat and reduces glare. These films are more efficient in blocking heat but may affect the external appearance.</p></p>
