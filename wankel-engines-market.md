<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Wankel Engines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Water Cooled</li><li>Air Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Wankel engines are available in two market types - water-cooled and air-cooled. </p><p>Water-cooled Wankel engines use a liquid coolant to transfer heat away from the engine components. The coolant circulates through channels and passages around the engine to absorb heat and maintain an optimum operating temperature. This type of engine is commonly found in vehicles and larger applications where efficient cooling is crucial for prolonged and high-performance use. </p><p>On the other hand, air-cooled Wankel engines rely on the surrounding air to dissipate the heat generated during operation. Instead of a coolant, fins and external surfaces are designed to increase heat transfer to the air, effectively cooling the engine. This type of engine is often utilized in smaller applications with less demanding requirements, such as motorcycles or small aircraft, where simplicity and light weight are valued.</p></p>
