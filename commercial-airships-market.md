<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Commercial Airships Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Rigid</li><li>Semi Rigid</li><li>Non-rigid</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The commercial airships market can be categorized into three types: rigid, semi-rigid, and non-rigid airships. </p><p>Rigid airships have a solid framework, usually made of metal, which provides structural support and maintains the shape of the airship. This type of airship offers greater stability and control during flight.</p><p>Semi-rigid airships have a partially rigid structure, typically consisting of a keel or a backbone. This provides some rigidity while maintaining flexibility, allowing for better maneuverability and cargo capacity.</p><p>Non-rigid airships, also known as blimps, do not have any rigid structure and rely solely on the pressure of the gas inside to maintain their shape. These airships are more lightweight and flexible, making them suitable for advertising purposes or short-distance travel.</p></p>
