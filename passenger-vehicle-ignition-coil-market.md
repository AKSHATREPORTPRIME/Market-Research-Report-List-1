<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Passenger Vehicle Ignition Coil Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-spark</li><li>Multi-spark</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The passenger vehicle ignition coil market can be categorized into single-spark and multi-spark types. Single-spark ignition coils are designed to generate one spark per ignition cycle, making them simpler and more cost-effective. On the other hand, multi-spark ignition coils produce multiple sparks per ignition cycle, leading to improved engine performance, fuel efficiency, and lower emissions. This technology achieves this by providing multiple ignition sparks to the spark plugs during each firing event. The choice between these two types depends on the specific requirements and preferences of vehicle manufacturers and consumers.</p></p>
