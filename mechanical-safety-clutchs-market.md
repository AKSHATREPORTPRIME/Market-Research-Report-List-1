<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Mechanical Safety Clutchs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Chimeric Type</li><li>Friction Type</li><li>Fracture Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Mechanical safety clutches are devices used to protect machinery and equipment from damage caused by excessive torque or force. There are three types of mechanical safety clutches: chimeric type, friction type, and fracture type. </p><p>Chimeric type clutches use a combination of mechanical and electronic components to quickly disengage the clutch when a predetermined torque is exceeded. </p><p>Friction type clutches rely on friction between two surfaces to control the amount of torque transmitted. Excessive torque causes the friction surfaces to slip, disengaging the clutch. </p><p>Fracture type clutches have a predetermined fracture point that breaks under excessive torque, disconnecting the transmission. </p><p>These market segments cater to different industrial needs for safeguarding machinery and equipment.</p></p>
