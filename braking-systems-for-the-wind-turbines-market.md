<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Braking Systems for the Wind Turbines Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Yaw Brakes</li><li>Rotor Brakes</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Braking systems are crucial components in wind turbines to ensure safe operations. Yaw brakes are designed to slow down and stop the turning motion of the turbine's nacelle in strong winds or during maintenance. This helps to prevent excessive stress on the mechanical parts. On the other hand, rotor brakes are responsible for stopping the rotation of the rotor blades, enabling maintenance work and providing emergency shutdown in situations such as grid faults or severe weather conditions. Both types of brakes play vital roles in maintaining the wind turbine's overall efficiency and safety.</p></p>
