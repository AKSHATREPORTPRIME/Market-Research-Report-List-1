<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Ad Blue Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>SCR</li><li>EGR</li><li>PostCombustion</li></ul></p>
<p><p>AdBlue is used to reduce emissions in vehicles and is available in different market types. Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR) systems inject AdBlue into the exhaust stream, where it reacts with harmful nitrogen oxides to convert them into water and nitrogen. Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) systems recirculate a portion of the exhaust gases back into the engine, reducing the oxygen levels and lowering combustion temperatures. PostCombustion systems inject AdBlue directly into the combustion chamber, aiding in the reduction of emissions. These market types cater to different vehicle configurations and emission control requirements.</p></p>
