<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Bio Jet Fuel Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO)</li><li>Fischer Tropsch (FT)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Bio Jet Fuel is a renewable alternative to conventional jet fuel, which helps reduce carbon emissions from aviation. There are two main types of bio jet fuel markets - Hydrogenated Vegetable Oil (HVO) and Fischer Tropsch (FT). HVO is produced by hydrogenating vegetable oils or animal fats, resulting in a high-quality fuel with properties similar to conventional jet fuel. FT, on the other hand, involves converting biomass or fossil fuel feedstocks into liquid hydrocarbons through a series of chemical reactions, producing a synthetic jet fuel that is suitable for aviation use.</p></p>
