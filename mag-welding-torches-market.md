<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The MAG Welding Torches Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Air Cooled</li><li>Water Cooled</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>The MAG welding torches market includes two types: air-cooled and water-cooled torches. Air-cooled torches rely on the natural convection of air to cool down the welding torch during operation. These torches are typically lightweight and compact, making them suitable for light to medium-duty welding applications. On the other hand, water-cooled torches use a circulating water system to cool down the torch, ensuring efficient and continuous operation for heavy-duty welding tasks. These torches are larger in size but provide superior cooling capabilities for prolonged use at higher amperages.</p></p>
