<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Glass Tempering Furnaces Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Horizontal Type</li><li>Vertical Type</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Flat glass tempering furnaces are used to strengthen glass by subjecting it to intense heat and rapid cooling. There are two types of flat glass tempering furnaces: horizontal and vertical. Horizontal furnaces have a conveyor system and use flat rollers to transfer glass through the heating and cooling chambers. They are typically used for large-scale production. On the other hand, vertical furnaces have a bottom-to-top conveyance system and are ideal for small-scale production because they occupy less floor space. Both types of furnaces provide efficient and effective glass tempering solutions.</p></p>
