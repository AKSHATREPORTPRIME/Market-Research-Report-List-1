<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Tritium Batteries Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Thermal Conversion Batteries</li><li>Non-Thermal Conversion Batteries</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Tritium batteries are available in two types - thermal conversion batteries and non-thermal conversion batteries. Thermal conversion batteries generate energy from the heat produced by the radioactive decay of Tritium. This heat is then converted into electricity using thermocouples. On the other hand, non-thermal conversion batteries use the emitted beta radiation from Tritium for direct conversion into electrical energy through specific semiconductor materials. Both types serve as power sources by harnessing the energy released by Tritium decay, with different methods of conversion to generate electricity.</p></p>
