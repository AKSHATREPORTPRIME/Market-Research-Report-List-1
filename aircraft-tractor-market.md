<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Aircraft Tractor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Aircraft Tractor market can be categorized into two types: Conventional Tractors and Towbarless Tractors. Conventional Tractors are equipped with a towbar, which is connected to the aircraft's landing gear during towing operations. They provide reliable and efficient towing for smaller aircraft. On the other hand, Towbarless Tractors eliminate the need for a separate towbar by using an integrated lifting mechanism. These tractors are designed for larger aircraft and offer improved maneuverability and ease of operation. Both types serve the purpose of towing and moving aircraft on the tarmac, but their features and capabilities differ based on the size and requirements of the aircraft being towed.</p></p>
