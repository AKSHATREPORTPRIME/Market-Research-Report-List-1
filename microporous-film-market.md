<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Microporous Film Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Unidirectional Stretching</li><li>Biaxial Stretching</li></ul></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><p>Microporous film is a type of material that has small pores, allowing for moisture vapor transmission while preventing the passage of liquids. There are two main types of production methods for microporous films: unidirectional stretching and biaxial stretching. In unidirectional stretching, the film is stretched in one direction, resulting in a film with better breathability and moisture vapor transmission. On the other hand, biaxial stretching involves stretching the film in both the machine (lengthwise) and the transverse (widthwise) directions, resulting in a film with improved mechanical properties and dimensional stability.</p></p>
